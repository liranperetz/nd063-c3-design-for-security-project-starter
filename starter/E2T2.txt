Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I am listing the findings that are related to the code:
- Security groups should not allow unrestricted access to ports with high risk
- Security groups should not allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 or ::/0 to port 22
- Security groups should not allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 or ::/0 to port 3389
- Security groups should only allow unrestricted incoming traffic for authorized ports
- CloudTrail should be enabled and configured with at least one multi-Region trail that includes read and write management events
- EC2 instances should not have a public IPv4 address
- EBS Encryption by default is not enabled.
- This Amazon VPC doesn't use a VPC endpoint for service


Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-   Security groups should not allow * 
    Follow least privilege principle and restrict the Security groups to accept ONLY needed traffic. for example we need to create 2 different security groups 
    for our EC2 instances, the application server should not acceps SSH / RDP ports. The application EC2 can accept be set to accept traffic only from ALB by retricting it
    to its dedicated SG.

-   EC2 instances should not have a public IPv4 address
    The ALB will forward the traffic to the EC2, 
    we can also put the EC2 in private subnet and use VPC Link to allow the communication between them.

-   EBS Encryption by default is not enabled
    Enable EBS encryption When creating the EC2 instance.
    In our IaC we can create the EC2 with encrypted EBS by addiing 'BlockDeviceMappings' configuration.

-   This Amazon VPC doesn't use a VPC endpoint for service
    We can setup VPC endpoints to allow AWS services to communicate inside the AWS network instead of getting out to the internet, 
    it will reduce costs and gain security.

-   Extra
    As we use IaC, we need to apply static code analysis (like we studied earlier in the course) like Regula to detect those vulnerabilities and avoid
    from misconfiguration and/or poor practices
