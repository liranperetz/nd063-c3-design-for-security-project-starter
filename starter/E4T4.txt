# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.
First I want to create an API GW that will be the only component that will be internet facing, on that API GW I will enable Netwrok ACL, Authrorizer (JWT, API Key..).
I will change the ALB to be internal and also the EC2 I will bind the API GW to the ALB by using a VPC link.
The free receipts s3 bucket will be accessible to the application server via VPC Endpoint with read only policy while the secrets receipts will be accessible only
from the console by authorized users with MFA.

# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.
No, it will be more secure but not by its own.

# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?
No, it will encrypt files that will be added after the change.

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.
Cloud formation will override all manual changes.
