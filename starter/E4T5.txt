# Brainstorm and list additional hardening suggestions aside from those implemented that would protect the data in this environment
- Use HTTPS for all communication between the load balancer and clients.
- Ensure that only necessary services and daemons are running on EC2 instances.
- Implement automated patch management to keep the operating system and application dependencies up to date.
- Use CloudTrail Insights to detect unusual API activity.
- Configure AWS GuardDuty to detect unauthorized activities and enable AWS WAF on the load balancer for web application security.
- Add explicit deny statements in the S3 bucket policy to block access from any source outside the VPC endpoint.
- Enable S3 object lock and versioning to prevent accidental or malicious deletion of sensitive data.
- Ensure all S3 buckets have default encryption enabled.
- Encrypt all additional EBS volumes attached to instances.
